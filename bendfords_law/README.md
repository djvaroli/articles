# Bendford's Law

## Running the Code

To re-run the code I used when generating the plots in the articles, you have two options. 
1. Clone the repo and install dependencies locally (best for developers)
2. Run the code using Deepnote (best for non-developers)
   
### 1. Installing Dependencies Locally
To install locally you can start by cloning the repo.

### 2. Run Using Deepnote
Simply navigate to the URL below and run the code as is (you won't be able to edit)
